Note - the work here is currently unpublished so certain proprietary datasets won't be included until publication. 

Code affiliated with 4T1 Neutrophil paper based on the 2024 Parse (v3) sequencing run conducted by Ian and Rebecca.

This subrepository contains an initial analysis of a scRNAseq experiment conducted by the Shea Lab.

Shorthand experimental details: d0, d7, d14, and d21 lung, scaffold and blood from 4T1-inoculated Balb/c mice were collected and processed for single cell sequencing during the summer of 2022.

Full experimental detail: Orthotopic inoculation of tumor cells was performed 2 weeks after scaffold implantation. 4T1-luc2-tdTomato murine triple negative breast cancer cells (PerkinElmer) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, INFO) for 5 days (37C, #% CO2, #% O2) prior to inoculation. Tumor cells were enzymatically lifted from the tissue culture flask with trypsin (INFO probably Sigma) for 10 minutes at 37C and resuspended in culture medium. Cells were centrifuged at 500xg for 5 minutes and resuspended in Dulbeccoâ€²s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) at a concentration of 40E6 cells/mL. The tumor cell line was previously confirmed to be pathogen free and authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA analysis and compared to the ATCC STR profile database (DDC Medical). Orthotopic inoculations were performed by injecting 50 uL of the cell suspension, containing 2E6 4T1 tumor cells, to the fourth right mammary fat pad of 12-week-old female Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, 000651). Scaffolds, lungs, and blood were collected from n=10 mice per timepoint (day 0 (healthy control), day 7 (pre-metastatic disease), d14 (intermediate disease), and d21 (late-stage disease). Tissues were processed to a single cell suspension and fixed for sequencing using a Parse Biosciences v1 fixation kit. Samples were submitted to the University of Michigans Advanced Genomics core for sample processing and sequencing.
